## ✨ Features

### 🍅 Pomodoro-Style Reading Sessions
Stay focused with a built-in Pomodoro timer that ties directly to your **currently reading** books. Track sessions, total read time, and celebrate your progress with **confetti**!

### 🧠 Word Vault
Encountered a new word? Save it to your personal vault. Definitions are fetched instantly, and each word is saved *per book* so you can revisit and reinforce your vocabulary later.

Sometimes reading can feel lonely. ReadBot is a gentle, emotion-aware chatbot that’s always there if you want to reflect, chat, or need a nudge.

### 📖 Google Books Integration
Search and add books directly from the Google Books API. Mark them as “Read,” “Currently Reading,” or add to your Wishlist.

### 📊 Personal Stats
Track your reading journey with meaningful stats: books read, pages tracked, and session history.
